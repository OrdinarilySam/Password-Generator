In terminal use sys args to remove characters

- \-x [int] changes the length
- \-l removes lowercase letters
- \-u removes uppercase letters
- \-n removes numbers
- \-s removes special characters

Currently no way to change the special characters used unless you edit the code, but I will make args to change those as well
